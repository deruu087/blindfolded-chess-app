It requires White to make two extremely weak moves (f3 and g4) that severely weaken the king's position. This pattern is rarely seen in actual games as it requires White to make such poor moves that most players would never consider them. The name 'Fool's Mate' comes from the fact that only a fool would make such terrible moves. This checkmate pattern is often used as a teaching tool to demonstrate the importance of king safety in the opening."

The game demonstrates why developing pieces (Nf3) is more important than grabbing material in the opening—and that even the 'normal' 3.Nf3 line leads to mate after Qh4+ and Qxe4#, showing the dangers of the King's Gambit when not played precisely."
